A clean, responsive iOS sample app that displays a curated list of Korean meals in a grid layout. Built using **SwiftUI** and **MVVM architecture**, this project showcases scalable app structure, real-world UI polish, and component-driven development — ideal for interviews, freelancing, and App Store prep.
